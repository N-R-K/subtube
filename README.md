# SUBTUBE

Easy to use script that lets you watch your subscribed youtube channels with no distraction that youtube page has. Script has couple of dependecies, and my personal version has modified sxiv, therefore screenshot is not accurate to most of you (just showing off possibilities).

# DUNST

Put this block to your dunst config to avoid notification spam of update progress. If you dont want this notification at all, try "secret_update" command.

```
[subtube]
    summary = *SUBTUBE - Update*
    set_stack_tag = 55
```
